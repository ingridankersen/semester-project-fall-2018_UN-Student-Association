        <p>Finally, the semester has started, and we are extremely proud of our over 70 active UN-Students! Our members are showing engagement and hard work and with our many collaborators the work of the UN-Students Oslo will reach new heights. I am already looking forward to the UN Theme Week 2019, and recommend everyone to save the dates March 3rd- 9th.</p>

        <p>InforMED reports; “Across the world, there are countries that play host to more than 10+ official languages. South Africa is an example of this, along with India which houses 10 000 + dialects!” The InforMED team can duly note that language barriers have the potential to lead to multiple negative outcomes. InforMED’s solution to breaking the language barriers between healthcare professionals and their patients is simple, effective, user-friendly and innovative.</p>
        <p>They have developed an offline mobile language translation application which aids the healthcare professional in creating a more refined differential diagnosis prior to the physical exam. InforMED is a team comprised of 4 global innovators, put together by the Young Sustainable Impact (YSI) program. Having won the Earthpreneurs Conference event (nurtured by Yara International) in August 2018 – they are the literal embodiment of passionate, driven and motivational worldwide change-agents.</p>
        <p>InforMED are looking for qualified healthcare practioners who are fluent in English and another language, primarily to help with medical statement translations. Contact them via email if you are interested or have any questions!</p>
